## Some Python code

Here's some Python code!

```{pyodide}
def trial_division(n):
    f = 2
    factors = []
    while f*f <= n:
        while n % f == 0:
            factors.append(f)
            n //= f
        f += 1 if f == 2 else 2  # tiny optimization
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

trial_division(62894113)
```
